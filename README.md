NYCDSA Shiny Project BDS024

Date: 1/31/2021

Summary:
This shiny dashboard is based on NYC Dept of Education's testing and quality survey results from 2015-2019.  
The dashboard provides users with the ability to get rich data and context about a single school, its district and  the city overall.  
It seeks to be a useful tool for parents, teachers and administrators. Enjoy!
